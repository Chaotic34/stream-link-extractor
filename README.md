# stream-link-extractor
This addon was made to easily copy links and weed out the links that did not connect. 
This was primarly developed in finding active streams of sport events.
You select an element containing multiple links, the add on then copies all the found streaming links into your clipboard, and following a promt, will open all the links in your tabs.

future improvements:
-Opening all links could cause some malicous websites to be opened.
